	abstract = {In recent years, the application of metaheuristic techniques to solve multi-objective optimization problems has become an active research area. Solving this kind of problems involves obtaining a set of Pareto-optimal solutions in such a way that the corresponding Pareto front fulfils the requirements of convergence to the true Pareto front and uniform diversity. Most of the studies on metaheuristics for multi-objective optimization are focused on Evolutionary Algorithms, and some of the state-of-the-art techniques belong this class of algorithms. Our goal in this paper is to study open research lines related to metaheuristics but focusing on less explored areas to provide new perspectives to those researchers interested in multi-objective optimization. In particular, we focus on non-evolutionary metaheuristics, hybrid multi-objective metaheuristics, parallel multi-objective optimization and multi-objective optimization under uncertainty. We analyze these issues and discuss open research lines.},

The limitations of time windows has many applications in the real world, however it has not been noticed enough in the CLRP problem. This article considers the capacitated location-routing problem with hard time windows (CLRPHTW). In this paper, first a mixed-integer linear programming model for CLRPHTW problem is presented and then in order to solve this problem a meta-heuristic method based on variable neighborhood search algorithm is proposed. To assess the performance of the proposed method, this framework is examined with a set of examples. The computational tests demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed method.},

	abstract = {The third edition of this handbook is designed to provide a broad coverage of the concepts, implementations, and applications in metaheuristics. The book's chapters serve as stand-alone presentations giving both the necessary underpinnings as well as practical guides for implementation. The nature of metaheuristics invites an analyst to modify basic methods in response to problem characteristics, past experiences, and personal preferences, and the chapters in this handbook are designed to facilitate this process as well. This new edition has been fully revised and features new chapters on swarm intelligence and automated design of metaheuristics from flexible algorithm frameworks. The authors who have contributed to this volume represent leading figures from the metaheuristic community and are responsible for pioneering contributions to the fields they write about. Their collective work has significantly enriched the field of optimization in general and combinatorial optimization in particular. Metaheuristics are solution methods that orchestrate an interaction between local improvement procedures and higher level strategies to create a process capable of escaping from local optima and performing a robust search of a solution space. In addition, many new and exciting developments and extensions have been observed in the last few years. Hybrids of metaheuristics with other optimization techniques, like branch-and-bound, mathematical programming or constraint programming are also increasingly popular. On the front of applications, metaheuristics are now used to find high-quality solutions to an ever-growing number of complex, ill-defined real-world problems, in particular combinatorial ones. This handbook should continue to be a great reference for researchers, graduate students, as well as practitioners interested in metaheuristics},

	abstract = {Enhancing the exploration and exploitation of multimodal optimization is still an interesting and challenging problem in optimization. Here we present a new population-based evolutionary algorithm for multiple optimal determinations. The approach is simply based on partitioning the genotypic search space and running a simple genetic algorithm with a small population within each partition. To increase the efficiency of the algorithm, the first-order discrete derivative of the fitness function for elite solutions was used to omit extra solutions. If the derivative of the fitness function is larger than a specified gradient threshold, no optimum exists within a given partition, and no population is created there after the first iteration. Except the adjusted gradient threshold, the proposed algorithm requires no other parameters rather than those of classical genetic algorithms. Moreover, unlike the other well-known algorithms, the proposed algorithm is not sensitive to the niche radius, and it needs no prior knowledge about the fitness function. The algorithm was tested for 10 multimodal benchmark functions, and its results were compared with the other related algorithms considering 4 commonly performance criteria. Our results show that the proposed algorithm is not only acceptable in terms of diversification and function evaluation number, but also has improved efficiency as compared to the others.},

	abstract = {The resource constrained project scheduling problem (RCPSP) can be given as follows. A single project consists of a set J = \{0, 1, . . . , n, n+1\} of activities which have to be processed. Fictitious activities 0 and n+1 correspond to the “project start” and to the “project end”, respectively. The activities are interrelated by two kinds of constraints. First, precedence constraints force activity j not to be started before all its immediate predecessor activities comprised in the set Pj have been finished. Second, performing the activities requires resources with limited capacities. We have K resource types, given by the set K = \{1, . . . ,K\}. While being processed, activity j requires rj,k units of resource type k ∈ K during every period of its non–preemptable duration pj . Resource type k has a limited capacity of Rk at any point in time. The parameters pj , rj,k, and Rk are assumed to be deterministic; for the project start and end activities we have pj = 0 and rj,k = 0 for all k ∈ K. The objective of the RCPSP is to find precedence and resource feasible completion times for all activities such that the makespan of the project is minimized. Figure 1 gives an example of a project comprising n = 6 activities which have to be scheduled subject to K = 1 renewable resource type with a capacity of 4 units. A feasible schedule with an optimal makespan of 13 periods is represented in Figure 2. Let Fj denote the finish time of activity j. A schedule S is given by a vector of finish times (F1, F2, . . . , Fn). Let A(t) = \{j ∈ J {\textbar} Fj − pj ≤ t {\textless} Fj\} be the set of activities which are being processed (active) at time instant t. We now can provide the conceptual decision model (1) – (4) (cf. Christofides et al. 1987).},

	abstract = {This research aggregates the knowledge gained from 99 retrospectives conducted in 74 organizations over the past seven years and uses the findings to reveal the most common mistakes and suggest best practices for more effective project management. In recent years, IT project failures have received a great deal of attention in the press as well as the boardroom. In an attempt to avoid disasters going forward, many organizations are now learning from the past by conducting retrospectives—that is, project postmortems or post-implementation reviews. While each individual retrospective tells a unique story and contributes to organizational learning, even more insight can be gained by examining multiple retrospectives across a variety of organizations over time. This research aggregates the knowledge gained from 99 retrospectives conducted in 74 organizations over the past seven years. It uses the findings to reveal the most common mistakes and suggest best practices for more effective project management.2},

A random key and the related mode list (ML) representation scheme are used as encoding schemes and the multi-mode serial schedule generation scheme (MSSGS) is considered as the decoding procedure. In this paper, a simple, efficient fitness function is proposed which has better performance compared to the other fitness functions in the literature. Defining a new mutation operator for ML is the other contribution of the current study. Comparing the results of the proposed GA with other approaches using the well-known benchmark sets in PSPLIB validates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm to solve the MRCPSP.},

This work deals with the multi-mode resource-constrained project scheduling problem. In this problem, activities of the project may be executed in more than one operating mode and renewable resource constraints exist. Each activity operation mode has a different duration and requires different amount of renewable resources. The objective function considered is the minimisation of the project completion time. Heuristics based on priority rule are considered as solution procedures for this problem. Both, parallel and serial scheduling generation schemes are described in the multi-mode context. On the basis of a well-known set of project instances, the new heuristics based on priority rules are evaluated against the best ones published. Finally, multi-pass heuristics based on priority rules that outperforms the deterministic multi-pass heuristic previously published are designed.},

	abstract = {This paper addresses a general class of nonpreemptive resource-constrained project scheduling problems in which activity durations are discrete functions of committed renewable and nonrenewable resources. We provide a well known 0–1 problem formulation and stress the importance of the model by giving applications within production and operations management. Furthermore, we prove that the feasibility problem is already NP-complete. Solution procedures proposed so far have the following shortcomings: exact methods can solve only very small instances to optimality; heuristic solution approaches fail to generate feasible solutions when problems become highly resource-constrained. Hence, we propose a new local search method that first tries to find a feasible solution and secondly performs a single-neighborhood search on the set of feasible mode assignments. To evaluate the new procedure we perform a rigorous computational study on two benchmark sets. The experiment includes a comparison of our procedure with other heuristics.},

However, the MRCPSP is a strong NP-hard problem and very difficult to be solved. The purpose of this research is to investigate a more efficient alternative based on ant algorithm to solve MRCPSP. To enhance the generality along with efficiency of the algorithm, the rule pool is designed to manage numerous priority rules for MRCPSP. Each ant is provided with an independent thread and endowed with the learning ability to dynamically select the excellent priority rules. In addition, all the ants in the ant algorithm have the prejudgment ability to avoid infeasible routes based on the branch and bound method. The algorithm is tested on the well-known benchmark instances in PSPLIB. The computational results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},
